[Verse 1]
Honey, can you see?
That you belong to me
Baby, won't you shape me
Into the lights of the sun
Baby, won't you make me
All of the things you dream up

[Chorus]
All the things that you dream up
All the things that you dream up
All the things that you dream up

[Hook]
Baby, save me

[Bridge]
Can you fathom my
Mon ange, mi amor
Can you fathom my
Mon ange, mi amor
Can you fathom my
Can you fathm my
(Can you)
Can you fathom my
(Can you)

[Verse 2]
Baby, won't you take me
To places I've never heard
Baby, don't you make me
Replace my actions with hurts
Replace, replace my actions
(Mon ange, mi amor)
Replace, replace my actions
(Mon ange, mi amor)
