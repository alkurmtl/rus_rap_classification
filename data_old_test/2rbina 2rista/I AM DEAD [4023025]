[Verse 1]
It’s dirty place… get ready for season of rains
Our rusted wheels riding around your saints
Wobble sounds - background for the messes here!
Hellbounds welcome the church of nuclear!
We are the voodoo ministry in music industry, maan
Circle number nine - our Downing Street 10
Tonight we have some pain, and now it’s crucial
The usual thing, when you stop to believe in illusion
You have no choice: everybody hurts, everything kills
Tonight we have for neo only two red pills
Just keep it real, and you will stay alive
Nuclear winter, shakespeare sonet number five
We are walking dead, homies
Selfie-makers and iphone zombies
Every live shows watching on a touch-screen
But if i could do something, I can not die trying

[Chorus]
BECAUSE I AM DEAD
CAUSE I'M DEAD!
BECAUSE I AM DEAD
CAUSE I'M DEAD!
BECAUSE I AM DEAD
CAUSE I'M DEAD!
BECAUSE I AM DEAD
I... I...

[Verse 2]
Life is a crazy race, and we are driving well
Sometimes it feels I am the last alive in hell
But I’m dead for you, because you bring me nothing
Real freedom always looking so disgusting
I’ve heard it over seven billion times
I’ve read it both in prose and in the poet rhymes
I’ve been alive so long, I’m still a cheerful dude
But I have x-ray view for almost each of you
This is a miracle: we give u wobble bass
One snap - and all your base belong to us
A kind of magic: I am a bad santa
For every pretty girl i have a magic wand’a
Right roundah, right round!
Fucking satan sanatorium welcome
Today it’s time to be insanely mad
But you will see yourself, this is not something bad

[Chorus]
BECAUSE I AM DEAD (BECAUSE I AM DEAD)
CAUSE I'M DEAD!
BECAUSE I AM DEAD
CAUSE I'M DEAD!
BECAUSE I AM DEAD
CAUSE I'M DEAD!
BECAUSE I AM DEAD
I... I...
