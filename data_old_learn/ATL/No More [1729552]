She don't love me no more...

[Verse 1]
I remember our last night
Cruisin' in my ride
We were sitting in the car she looked into my eyes
An' said "I love u"...(I love u baby)
"I'm gonna miss u"...(Gonna miss u so much)
Now everything (thing) it was cool (cool)
But the 1st, 2 weeks
(Call me on, on my fone, said that she, misses me)
Now it seems, that as of late
She's always, on the go
I kno she's startin', another life
But lately I'm, feeling like..

[Chorus]
Feel like she don't want...want me no more
Said I feel she don't need...need me no more
Said I really don't kno tha deal
As the days go by I feel
That the one I love don't love...love me no more

[Verse 2]
Now don't u say I've got it wrong (don't u tell me I got it wrong)
Cos when I call u on the fone (u kno how it is)
Ur either asleep, ur not at home, or u don't, have time to talk
So why don't chu tell me, what's goin' on, cos ur breakin' my heart
And girl u act like u don't care
Tell me what, is goin' on down there
And that I can't meet, ur new friends, I dnt even kno where u live
Cos u won't even let me come see u for tha weekend....whoa...oh...

[Chorus]
Feel like she don't want...want me no more
Said I feel she don't need...need me no more
Said I really don't kno tha deal
As the days go by I feel
That the one I love don't love...love me no more

What's goin' on with us man...

[Bridge]
Now I love that girl so much
It's gotten hard to letting her go
She's always on my mind, all the time
Jus last week I called her on the fone, an i said:

[Taken from Aaliyah's "I Miss U"]

(It's been too long and I'm lost without u)
What am I gonna do
Said I've been needing u, wanting u
(Wondering if ur tha same and who's been with u)
Is ur heart still mine, I wanna cry sometimes
I miss u...

[Chorus to fade...]
