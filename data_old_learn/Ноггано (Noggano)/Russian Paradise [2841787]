[Intro]
Eyes, eyes
Just look in my eyes
Just look in my eyes and you will see Russian paradise

[Chorus]
Just look in my eyes and you will see Russian paradise
Just look in my eyes and you will see Russian paradise
Come on guys
Just look in my eyes and you will see Russian paradise
Just look in my eyes and you will see Russian paradise

[Verse 1: Noggano]
Hello, my name is Vasya and I'm from Rostov-on-Don
And right now making rap on the microphone
I show you real hood, very very bad hood
No shoes, no hope and bad food
But this is my roots, my truth
Adidas boots and cap Chicago Bulls
Cops wanna catch me every day and every night
But I am not afraid and smoke Parliament Light
Yesterday, I installed Skype on my comp
But they cut off the light in my home
I'm not loosing hope, its better to live in this hole
Than go away and sell a soul
Somebody shot some brave heart
Somebody little fish, somebody blood shark
Somebody meet somebody and kill somebody
Those two buddies now have some money
My escalator is like Boeing 747
I start in this round at eleven
The time is 11:45
This is my life, my mind and my fly
I'm driving for my piece of a pie
And move my money to Dubai or Pattaya
This is russian ground, this is russian sky
Sorry mama, I'm a gangsta; very bad guy

[Chorus]
Just look in my eyes and you will see Russian paradise
Just look in my eyes and you will see Russian paradise
Come on guys
Just look in my eyes and you will see Russian paradise
Just look in my eyes and you will see Russian paradise

[Verse 2: АК-47 (Victor АК)]
Hi I'am a Vitya, from YEKB
City of Ekaterina, 287 years
I write my rap, only for you
Because you say: Man, this is true
Today I go our studio Gazgolder
And create on computer new folder
J push rec, rec
I sing rap, rap
Microphone check check
This is real shit shit
Mama i miss you, coming soon, I go home
I cry, when they see my photo album
I don't forget about, my Byaroza friend
Moscow is great, I create new rap
I don't have here girlfriend
My last girl say: Fuck you man
Fuck your rap
Because I smoke everyday Marijuana
Marijuana, It's a number one
I play PlayStation on plasma in my flat
Tekken 6, Mortal Kombat vs. Universe
I play games with my friends
Yes, I like kill police on Vice City streets

[Chorus]
Just look in my eyes and you will see Russian paradise
Just look in my eyes and you will see Russian paradise
Come on guys
Just look in my eyes and you will see Russian paradise
Just look in my eyes and you will see Russian paradise

[Verse 3: АК-47 (Maxim АК)]
Dear uncle, I'm your nephew, son of your brother
Grandson of your mother and your daughter's cousin
Aunt say that you lives in USA
Sorry for mistakes, Google Translate
Yesterday I opened my bank account
Please send me dollars in any amount
Visa already in passport, I'm going fast
You and Aunt, will be my mother and father
Long time ago, when I was a kid
Bad guys teached me, how to smoke weed
Now I have no bad habits, silent black rabbits
Psychology training, made me happy and friendly
I have a dream, my dear uncle Vova
I will fly to you very soon, Ural to Iowa
A kiss to your children, my letter is over
У тебя там Paradise, а тут хуево

[Chorus]
Just look in my eyes and you will see Russian paradise
Just look in my eyes and you will see Russian paradise
Come on guys
Just look in my eyes and you will see Russian paradise
Just look in my eyes and you will see Russian paradise
Just look in my eyes and you will see Russian paradise
Just look in my eyes and you will see Russian paradise
Come on guys
Just look in my eyes and you will see Russian paradise
Just look in my eyes and you will see Russian paradise
