Hey May, know it's kind of late,
May-be i just miss your face
How, does it taste
They sprinkle all your words in April showers
Remember when we used to speak for hours,
for hours went by
No sunshine outside
I can hear your flow-ers blooming now,
(Hey May)
All your little girls [?]
(Hey May, hey May, hey May)
I can hear your flow-ers blooming now,
All your little girls [?]
Let me up your smile upon the ground
