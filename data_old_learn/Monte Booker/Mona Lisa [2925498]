[Verse 1]
Come on, let's go
I'm on a roll
I only need a dollar in my pocket

Attract the gold
Just let it mold into your hands
And watch the love turn it into a locket

Stay on the move
Until the moon
Goes round and round and round
In circles, clockin'

Don't let the blues
Catch up to you
Because...

[Hook]
I'm on a first-name basis with danger
It's stranger when I'm there
I'll let the narrator tell you how it goes

I'm on a first-name basis with danger
It's stranger when I'm there
I'll let the narrator tell you how it goes

Just like his name was James Earl Jones

[Verse 2]
I knew you a long time ago
(break)

Got your passport
Got your visa
Where's your smile like
Mona Lisa

[Outro]
Smile like Mona Lisa
Smile like Mona Lisa
Smile like Mona Lisa
Smile like Mona Lisa
Smile like Mona Lisa
Smile like Mona Lisa
