[Refrain: Phoelix]
She can't leave her friend, her friend
She can hop right in, 3 piece for the win
Knock on four walls with a grin now
She can't leave her friend, her friend
She can hop right in, 3 piece for the win
Knock on four walls with a grin now

[Verse 1: Smino]
I’m from the arch
I treat my nemesis harsh
I spot a lame cross the yard
Booches be parched
No you can't trap me with boobie
My pull out game on garage
I swear fa God
God wrote my life like a movie
I’m out here playing my part
Smeezy Segal
Right now I'm above the law
Puffin a puffy cigar
Country as fuck
I keep a horse on my balls
I keep a horse on my balls
Leaving my mark
She heard that Smino was here
Then let me write on her walls
Cranberry drop
I heard it was good for the pussy
I heard it was good for the box
Kush in my sock
'Cause we headed straight to the gally
And you know 170 hot, ooohhh
Incoming call, from this lil' freak from New York
She said, she all about the Minaj
Plus she gone bring all her barbs, she blessed
I kiss my rosary, hoping these hoes
A be cold as this jamo and soda be
My pockets on Monique
These booches all on me
I feel like I'm Professor Oglevee

[Hook: Smino]
I been pumping this company
Lil somethin' plump keep me company
Real niggas round in good company
Company, company, company, company
I been pumping this company
Lil somethin' plump keep me company
Real niggas round in good company
Company, company, company, company

[Refrain: Phoelix]
She can't leave her friend, her friend
She can hop right in, 3 piece for the win
Knock on four walls with a grin now
She can't leave her friend, her friend
She can hop right in, 3 piece for the win
Knock on four walls with a grin now
She can't leave her friend, her friend
She can hop right in, 3 piece for the win
Knock on four walls with a grin now
She can't leave her friend, her friend
She can hop right in, 3 piece for the win
Knock on four walls with a grin now

[Verse 2: Smino]
Company, company, company, company
Zero that company, raised all our monthlies (whoa)
More booked then kindle
Old flame want rekindle
Bitch mama said I can't have company, so
Booked 'cause you know how lil' Monte be, I don't
Politic profit the policy
I honestly don't do no 'poligies
Inspiring, I got variety
And yo bitch want my body
I got more kicks then karate
Chris off the brown, that's Karrueche
She callin' me Smino papi
I feel like she chasing my D
But real niggas chasing deposits
The coupe color raspberry tea
Interior drip look like honey

[Outro: Smino]
Two thangs with me right now
(Bof’um thick)
Quit playing with me right now
(Throw some bitch)
Who sayin' we gone run out
(No, no, no, no)
Too many niggas rapping
(They ain't saying shit)
Dey’on like da mike
(They calvin cambridge)
Sound right alright
(I know, I know, I know)
Two thangs with me right now
(Bof’um thick)
Quit playing with me right now
(Throw some bitch)
Who sayin' we gone run out
(No, no, no, no)
Too many niggas rapping
(They ain't saying shit)
Dey’on like da mike
(They calvin cambridge)
Sound right alright
(I know, I know, I know)

[Hook: Smino]
I been pumping this company
Lil somethin' plump keep me company
Real niggas round in good company
Company, company, company, company
I been pumping this company
Lil somethin' plump keep me company
Real niggas round in good company
Company, company, company, company
