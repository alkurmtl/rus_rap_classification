[Verse 1]
Red velvet smooth
Creeping down
Might slide on through
See what I can do with this doob and this D'usse
Match vibes, smoke out
Match vibes, smoke out
You let me know
If this shit is everything that you wanted
Blue lights, black ice
Don't slip, I'll laugh
This weed west coast
Said you don't smoke never, gon' be high forever
Red Velvet coupe
Creeping down
Pull up on you
We can do whatever, depend on what you say
Red velvet

[Chorus]
Red velvet, velvet
Red velvet, velvet
Velvet (yeah, yeah)

[Bridge]
I fell in love with just taking my time
Pour me up straight, no, I don't need no ice
Straighten your face, it's a beautiful life
World on our backs, we got youth on our side
I fell in love with just taking my time

[Verse 2]
Shawty say "Smino, you forreal one of a kind
I mean nothing like I seen in my life"
Colder than a penguin shooting dice in the middle of the night
Outside drinking Henny on ice
A little too slick with the lingo, love how I speak though
Country-ass focused nigga
Never playing games, put the pussy in a grave
Write my name on the box like a homeless nigga
Feel like February 9th and the sun just right
Everytime I put the D in your life
Tryna paint a picture with the strokes, shit
Most times I brush the shit off by the end of the night
Cash coming by the klumps and your cleavage on Cletus
Why the fuck I got cake if a nigga can't eat it
Red velvet can't help it, need it every time I see it
Been gone too long, make the most out the evening

[Bridge]
R-E-D  V-E-L-V-E-T, baby
I can take you where you wanna be baby
R-E-D  V-E-L-V-E-T, baby
I can take you where you wanna be baby

[Verse 3]
Red velvet smooth
Creeping down
Might slide on though
See what I can do with this doob and this D'usse
Match vibes, smoke out
Match vibes, smoke out
You let me know
If this shit is everything that you wanted
Blue lights, black ice
Don't slip, I'll laugh
This weed west coast
Said you don't smoke never, gon' be high forever
Red Velvet coupe
Creeping down
Pull up on you
We can do whatever, depend on what you say
Red velvet

[Chorus]
Red velvet, velvet
Red velvet, velvet
Velvet (yeah, yeah)
Red velvet, velvet
Red velvet, velvet
Velvet (yeah, yeah)
