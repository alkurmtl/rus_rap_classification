[Pre-Hook]
Wussup? Baby, wussup?
When I throw that money, make this crowd line up like
One stack, two stacks, three stacks,tell the DJ run it back

[Hook]
Now bring that ass back like a boomerang
Now bring that ass back like a boomerang
Now bring that ass back like a boomerang
Through that ass back, let me catch it like a boomerang

[Verse 1]
Baby yea, show me how you dance
I see you need to drink, I pour shots of the Jack
Think it’s about time to let me see you clap
And throw it in reverse, baby you don’t need your hands nah
Bu-dunk-a-dunk trunk in my lap
Weebly-wobble how you make your ass do that?
You got my mind blown, boom, I’m gone
You knock me out of orbit, need white new gums
Fresh man, yea that’s me
Bitches call me double X over a magazine
When she grindin’ on me I’mma have to skateboard see
Yea baby far out, no scape on beat
You already know, I’mma hit that
Homerun, grand slam as who work it
Baby all I need is one more twerk
And bitch, you gotta go work I’m sayin’ though

[Pre-Hook]
Wussup? Baby, wussup?
When I throw that money, make this crowd line up like

[Hook]
Now bring that ass back like a boomerang
Now bring that ass back like a boomerang
Now bring that ass back like a boomerang
Throw that ass back, let me catch it like it’s boomerang

[Verse 2]
You catch it all, you anxious to spend it
Ladies showin’ love to the crew, yea we in this
Bottles of the mo’, got me feelin’ thrown
Got a couple girls and they all singin’ along
Like wussup? Baby, wussup?
Do the thing girl, don’t touch
Too nasty? So what
Just bring that ass back for me, bring that ass back for me
If you can make it clap I’mma throw a rack
Earthquake in the club, girl you hammer-jack
The way your booty go got me feelin’ like George swung up on the Cadillac, fuckin’ hot
No purple in the air, vanilla sky
Girl you can throw it back, let it fly
Yea, all I need is one more drink
And bitch, you gotta go work I’m sayin’ though
