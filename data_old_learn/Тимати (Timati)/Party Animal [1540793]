[Intro]
Black Star Inc. international proudly presents
Timati, DJ M.E.G., it’s going down, straight like that
Alright, yeah

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is, drink, get drunk
Party hard, get crunk
Stupid dumb go crazy
Then make out with all the ladies
I’m an animal, woof, woof
A party animal, woof, woof, woof

[Verse 1]
I’m busy drunk, girl you know what I want
And you don’t have to ask me cause I’m so fucked up
Put more inside my cup, I can feel it in my veins
And keep your piece of mind, I just want your brains
Now go insane, I’m higher than a plane
And everything is blurry, I cannot see a thing
Move bitch, get out my way
And it’s my party, do what the fuck I say

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is, drink, get drunk
Party hard, get crunk
Stupid dumb go crazy
Then make out with all the ladies
I’m an animal, woof, woof
A party animal, woof, woof, woof

[Verse 1]
High five, I’m turned on by the lights
It makes me feel like I, flyin’ through the sky
Who got the glow sticks, I’m feelin’ on her tits
And I think that she likes it cause she grindin’ on my
Oh shit, where did I drop my whip
Tell me where is my waitress
Bartender to my VIP
Sexy sexy girl strip
I might give you a chip
Loop both way before crossing
Or you just might hit

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is, drink, get drunk
Party hard, get crunk
Stupid dumb go crazy
Then make out with all the ladies
I’m an animal, woof, woof
A party animal, woof, woof, woof
All I wanna do is, drink, get drunk
Party hard, get crunk
Stupid dumb go crazy
Then make out with all the ladies
I’m an animal, woof, woof
A party animal, woof, woof, woof

[Chrous]
All I wanna do is, drink, drink, drink
Get drunk, drunk, drunk
Party, party, party, party
I’m an animal, woof, woof
A party animal, woof, woof, woof
