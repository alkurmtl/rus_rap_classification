[Intro]
Black Star, DJ Antoine, yeah, here we go now

[Verse 1]
Money I make, pockets can’t break
Pop champagne, everything’s straight
First class trips, high class chicks
Men selling cars, high class whips
We fall so hard in a shopping mall
Price tags we never look it all
Pay cash, or check or credit card
It don’t matter dogh cause we go!!!!!t it all
We do it big never small
I don’t say too much cause money talks
So going to check you at us
Used to be staying at the Palms Atlantis
Smocking shish with shish
Stacey, Alyssa, Tracey, Teresa
Turn the whole town, I want to believe in
Auuuu let’s go

[Hook]
If it ain’t ’bout money, it don’t make sense
If it ain’t ’bout money, it don’t make sense
And if it ain’t ’bout money, It don’t make sense
And I’m just trying to get me some of their friends and dance
And go like money money money
And we’d be getting money money money
And we’d be getting money money money
And we’d be getting money money money
If it ain’t ’bout money, it don’t make sense
And if it ain’t ’bout money, it don’t make sense
And if it ain’t ’bout money, it don’t make sense
And if it ain’t ’bout money, it don’t make sense
And I’m just trying to get me some of their friends and dance
And go like money money money
And we’d be getting money money money
And we’d be getting money money money
And we’d be getting money money money
If it ain’t ’bout money, it don’t make sense

[Verse 2]
Yes, you should be very impressed
When I pull up at in sea in my private jet
Million dollar wrist wear, I never stress
Spending money, ’cause every other day I collect
More money than we got palm trees
Cash days in my pocket like car keys
Can’t keep these model chicks on me
Rolls Royce, Lamborghini and Ferrari
I carry my chicks in these
They’re all living it good, getting whatever they need
I say to prepare, that’s why I put them in the street
I got money like that, yes indeed
I have to shut them all down ’cause we owned it
If you wanna do it big, look at how we’re rolling
Bugatti EB made out of gold
And it does what it told you to go down

[Hook]
If it ain’t ’bout money, it don’t make sense
If it ain’t ’bout money, it don’t make sense
And if it ain’t ’bout money, It don’t make sense
And I’m just trying to get me some of their friends and dance
And go like money money money
And we’d be getting money money money
And we’d be getting money money money
And we’d be getting money money money
If it ain’t ’bout money, it don’t make sense
And if it ain’t ’bout money, it don’t make sense
And if it ain’t ’bout money, it don’t make sense
And if it ain’t ’bout money, it don’t make sense
And I’m just trying to get me some of their friends and dance
And go like money money money
And we’d be getting money money money
And we’d be getting money money money
And we’d be getting money money money
Uh yeah
