[Intro: La La Land]
Goooo...
I’ve got to go, take me away real quick...
I’ve got to go, take me away real quick...

[Bridge]
Lonely, I’m so lonely, lonely, I’m so lonely
Take me away, take me away

[Verse 1: Timati]
Take me away to the place that I don’t know
Similar to the place that I do
Am I here, but am I really
’Cause it’s been a lot like deja vu
My mind is on something else
And that thing I only dream of
It’s more than just fame and wealth
’Cause those things are another way of keepin’ me here
And I don’t want to be so, take me away
To the place that can get to know me or know my name
Take me away, only I can take me away

[Hook]
On and on, feels so strong, it can’t be wrong
I want you to take me away, I’m Lonely, so lonely
On and on, feels so strong, it can’t be wrong
I want you to take me away, I’m Lonely, so lonely

[Verse 2: Timati]
You can’t find me, ’cause I’m not there
Yeah, I know me, but I’m not scared
I stay with me, cause I won’t leave
I don’t need you, so let me be
I appreciate what you’ve done
But now I look after number one
I know that it’s selfish, but it’s okay
Only I can take me away
No need to come back, I’m listenin’
I’m followin’ my own visions
And make sure that I do not stay
’Cause only I can take me away
Take me a-way, only I can take me away

[Hook]
On and on, feels so strong, it can’t be wrong
I want you to take me away, I’m Lonely, so lonely
On and on, feels so strong, it can’t be wrong
I want you to take me away, I’m Lonely, so lonely

[Verse 3]
You don’t know and feel my love
You don’t really know me
You don’t know, how’t fill my time
You just don’t know me, just don’t know me
You don’t know and feel my love
You don’t really know me
You don’t know, how’t fill my time
You just don’t know me, just don’t know me

[Bridge]
I’m lonely, so lonely (just don’t know me)
I’m lonely, so lonely (just don’t know me)

[Hook]
On and on, feels so strong, it can’t be wrong
I want you to take me away, I’m Lonely, so lonely
On and on, feels so strong, it can’t be wrong
I want you to take me away, I’m Lonely, so lonely

[Post-Hook]
You don’t know and feel my love
You don’t really know me
You don’t know, how’t fill my time
You just don’t know me

[Outro: Timati]
Take me a-way, only I can take me a-way
