[Intro: Mario Winans]
This is another one of Bad Boy classics
This is your boy Mario Winans
And my man Timati
Get right

[Chorus: Mario Winans]
Girl, I wanna get to know you better
Maybe we can spend the night together
This love will last forever and ever, forever
Girl, I wanna get to know you better
Maybe we can spend the night together
This love will last forever and ever, forever

[Verse 1: Timati]
As we lay in the bed and we’re looking at the moon
I put my fingers through your hair, we can dance around the room
Or we can kiss between the sheets, no one else but you and me
It will be a special day, what you say, hey
I want the world to know that everywhere I go
I got a girl’s guarantee to be down for sure
Nothing can come between us, no one can separate us
Just take my hand, I wish that we can be forever

[Chorus: Mario Winans]
Girl, I wanna get to know you better
Maybe we can spend the night together
This love will last forever and ever, forever
Girl, I wanna get to know you better
Maybe we can spend the night together
This love will last forever and ever, forever

[Verse 2: Timati]
As we lay in the bed and we’re looking at the moon
I put my fingers through your hair, we can dance around the room
Or we can kiss between the sheets, no one else but you and me
It will be a special day, what you say, hey
I want the world to know that everywhere I go
I got a girl’s guarantee to be down for sure
Nothing can come between us, no one can separate us
Just take my hand, I wish that we can be forever

[Bridge: Timati]
I don’t care about the past, I just wanna make it last
Girl, it’s only me and you so we’re gotta make this true
Baby, let’s take our time and you’ll always be mine
‘cause you brighten up my day and forever I will stay
I don’t care about the past, I just wanna make it last
Girl, it’s only me and you so we’re gotta make this true
Baby, let’s take our time and you’ll always be mine
‘cause you brighten up my day and forever I will stay

[Chorus: Mario Winans]
Girl, I wanna get to know you better
Maybe we can spend the night together
This love will last forever and ever, forever
Girl, I wanna get to know you better
Maybe we can spend the night together
This love will last forever and ever, forever
