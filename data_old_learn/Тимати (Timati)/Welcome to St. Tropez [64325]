[Intro: Timati]
Welcome to St. Tropez!

[Verse 1: Timati]
Get fresh, gotta stay fly
Get the jet, I gotta stay high
High up like a la la la
Ain’t nothin’ here that my money can’t buy
Dolce, Gucci and Louis V
Yacht so big I could live out in the sea
You for real? You can’t see me
In these Euro frames the whole world change
Mad bitches, so much broads
Feelin’ like when I wanna fuck them all
Get mad brain in my very fast car
Ferrari V12, Maranello on my arm
Ladies can’t resist the charm
Haters, kiss the ring of the Don
And we do this all day
Welcome to St. Tropez

[Hook: Kalenna]
Wild, wild enough
Too much money in the bank account
Hands in the air make you scream and shout
When we’re in St. Tropez
Wild, Wild enough
Spending money in a large amount
Hands in the air make you scream and shout
When we’re in St. Tropez

(Timati) St. Tropez
(Oh yeah)

[Verse 2: Timati]
We make money, money we spending
Get mad honeys, swimming in women
Imported linen, Egyptian cotton
The party just started, the party ain’t stoppin’
Keep shit poppin’, poppin’ these bottles
Haters keep hatin’, fuckin’ these models
So much money like we own the lotto
Pull up to a club in a white Murcielago
It don’t make dollars, it don’t make cents
It don’t make you rich, it don’t mean shit
Shit...we the shit...
I mean how much better can it get?
Harleys, Maseratis, Gallardos
We make too much dough
And we spend it all day
Welcome to St. Tropez

[Hook: Kalenna]
Wild, wild enough
Too much money in the bank account
Hands in the air make you scream and shout
When we’re in St. Tropez
Wild, Wild enough
Too much money in the bank account
Hands in the air make you scream and shout
When we’re in St. Tropez
Wild, wild enough
Spending money in a large amount
Hands in the air make you scream and shout
When we’re in St. Tropez
Wild, Wild enough
Spending money in a large amount
Hands in the air make you scream and shout
When we’re in St. Tropez

[Bridge: DJ Antoine]
Ladies and gentlemen, tonight, all the way from Moscow, Russia
Give a warm welcome for heavy weight rap champion B Smooth
So make some noise for the one and only, Mr. Black Star!

[Bridge: Kalenna & Timati]
Get it up, don’t stop your body
Come on ladies, let’s get naughty
Get it up, now everybody
Come on girls, here comes the daddy
Get it up, don’t stop your body
Get it up, again your body
Get it up, now everybody
Get it up for music

[Hook: Kalenna]
Wild, wild enough
Too much money in the bank account
Hands in the air make you scream and shout
When we’re in St. Tropez
Wild, Wild enough
Too much money in the bank account
Hands in the air make you scream and shout
When we’re in St. Tropez
Wild, wild enough
Spending money in a large amount
Hands in the air make you scream and shout
When we’re in St. Tropez
Wild, Wild enough
Spending money in a large amount
Hands in the air make you scream and shout
When we’re in St. Tropez

[Outro: Timati]
Welcome to St-Tropez
