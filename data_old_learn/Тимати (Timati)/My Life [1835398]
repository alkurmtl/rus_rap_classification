[Intro]
Blackstar, Matisse, Sadko, let’s go

[Hook]
All I wanna do is have a good time
Party the night away and live my life
All I wanna do is have a good time
Party the night away and live my life

[Verse 1]
We came here to drink, drink all our pain away
I’m celebrating a birthday here today
Get on the floor, girl, shake your ass now
I like the way that you move and how you get me down
Is that your girl? Is that your man?
Get her on the wall and grab her ass
Put your hands up high and touch the sky
Just live for the moment like you’re gonna die

[Hook]
All I wanna do is have a good time
Party the night away and live my life
All I wanna do is have a good time
Party the night away and live my life
All I wanna do is have a good time
Party the night away and live my life
All I wanna do is have a good time
Party the night away and live my life

[Verse 2]
I’m living my life, I’m partying
I think I see my new wife. I’m tripping, man
The liquor in me ain’t got me seeing couples
She got a big ol’ booty, I’m trying to pack that baggle
’Cause the lady’s so fly, so fly, uh
Tryin’ to make what it ain’t my girl
’Cause the lady so fly, so fly, uh
Break it out from this world
’Cause yes I can hit on my own
But tonight I promise I’m not leaving alone

[Bridge]
If you wanna play
Hands up, hands up, put your fucking hands up
Hands up, hands up, put your fucking hands up
Take your feet off the ground
Take your feet off the ground
Take your feet off the ground
Yeah, don’t fuck it up, let’s go
Hands up, hands up, put your fucking hands up
Hands up, hands up, put your fucking hands up
Take your feet off the ground
Take your feet off the ground
Take your feet off the ground
Yeah, don’t fuck it up, now

[Pre-Hook]
Blackstar, Matisse, Sadko, let’s go

[Hook]
All I wanna do is have a good time
Party the night away and live my life
All I wanna do is have a good time
Party the night away and live my life
Live my life, live my life, live my life, live my life
Live my life, live my life, live my life, live my life
