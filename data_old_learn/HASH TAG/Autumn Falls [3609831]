Verse 1[Hashtag]
All these beatles in my bands got living
Like John lennon
Am getting lifted by ordinary people of John Legend
And bastards
Hating on a boy that got chromes and
Caskets
Why you fake niggas so drastic?
Am lyrically your arsenal
Bullets tipping your articles
Living without a purpose am so prophetic and vatical                      
Sporadically am off the leash
Feasting on these pillars
And these bars I need to keep track
Straight to its appearance
Mayne indubitably am that nigga rapping with a segue
Slinging on that KK
Fuck boys need to menstruate
Spazzing on these sinister floors
Am too descrete
Yet they giving me these minimal scores I need some sleeves
I need some keys
So i can show this niggas what am made of
Ghosts inside my closet
Baracaded atoms
Protons and neutrons and everything that
Matters
The nebulas of hydrogen gas and angel dust
Am getting that codeine cup
And pour it down on the ground
R.I.P to all the spirits in this that got
Watered down
Epitaph is at the top
You gon bask in bones and bibles
If God is on your side you gon overcome all
Your rivals
Floor is full of marbles
Yet I sleep on fablics
Infatuated with noose loops and
Guillotines and concrete
That's how my momma raised me
I ain't scared of death threats from
Pendulums of babies
That swing slow on my fast moods
This flow is too Devine I add it to my
Bucket list
Am giving it on a lease
To every beat on my passion
It's an ice cold
Like iceberg I might slid
Get an orchestra, or go to autumn of
John Keats
Nigga

Bridge: [Cypro and Hashtag ]
Don't say jokes about me 
Count my mistakes without me
Don't say jokes about me
Or you'll fall like leaves in saint
Martins summer

Verse 2[Cypro]
Treat you like a rebel 
On different axis nigga you can't join our circle
Always sipping let me show you how the day go
Knuckles like my drink we punch until it's purple
Netflix in the day zone 
She 23 with no Jays on
She text text on her way home
Next next she on my crib
Nigga hating like how's he
Poison mixing like ivy, medication the loud be
Breaking laws and allow me to float, my head in the cloud
Never coming down definition of wild ones woah
Killed the choice to go under like the Indian summer, niggers leaves will crumble and fall
