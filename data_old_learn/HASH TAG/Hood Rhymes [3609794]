Yeah!!
For da Hood
For da hood. For da hood

[Verse 1:Hashtag]
I remember back at 17 I used to wanna be rappin'
The only fear that I had was to lose myself in this rappin'
Am fabricated by rumors that am the victim of tragedy
Infatuated with shooters I never mind i live drastic
Am at the back at the corner
Harnessing my lines, thinking if I get a label then I get to kill these Rhymes
Am staring at the window it's 997 in pursuit of a vehicle that got jammed on detour
I hit Cypro at his crib told me we should freestyle like how the rappers on televisions are doing freestyles
We was on that beat box
Saggin' on em pants dropping bars with no fill-ups
Then we met NEw told us we should make real beats out of FL studio
Thought if we make a track behind the beat it'll sound beautiful
I lined up the melodies, NEw had 808, Cypro had it all polished and made the niggas shake on it
We topped-off the project brought it to nigga Edokiss told us the beat was whack and that we couldn't drop a verse on it
We stress-recorded everything
Double backed home we was pitiful, reminiscin' on how we made it pivotal
But then we sparked a plan
What if we make a rap team grindin' to raise some dead presidents so we make a rap dream
It all went in shumbles
And then we got disbanded from our cohesion but the rap dream was still the vision
My baby told me Nirvana was the place to cast extinctions
Of self-pity and hatred if you bounded  in convictions
Don't fuck with the devil you might end up having sins your dick if you basking in the karma of that Buddhish temple
Eventually I had a call from my nigga Cypro said we had a new nigga in town that had a mic on
His name was Jeydak
A.K.A fuck your problems I'll make you the greatest Rapper if your raps are not so random
I didy first demo, niggas and bitches loved it and Nash told me I sounded like am not in Nyasaland
But am in Nyasaland
Malawi's throat groans when suits drop on that decent Classic Men are homegrown
Let me tell you where am coming from
Unspread the huge map on that centerfold
Am an African uh
Born and grazed in the land of Malawi man
Am rockin' on dirty vans and Marvin on that Cardigan
Am suited by my family ties
Yeah my fam retired
Tentative thoughts all these rappers are probably tired uh
Melanin dogs all these bitches got stretch mark thighs
Alien's void done smashed the earth in Pendleton flies
Parallel parking at the show with my niggas
Jammin' on stage am Reeboking with my niggas
Yellin' now we made it
Started from the bottom with land mines and random beats of Mike-Will-Made-It
Possible for average Joe's and ordinary Jane's to rap
I rewind the rap game then I take it back
I reshuffled all the flame then I flicked the rack
Niggas wanna walk in my shoes but that's impossible
Rubic's cubes I mean logical
Popping pills and lick popsicles uh
Like bears in cold weather am hibernated like uh
Fuck a cosign, passion is beat making if you name a drop on your favorite Rappers then you faking on Hash-mutherfucking-tag
