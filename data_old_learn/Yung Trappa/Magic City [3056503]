[Chorus: Yung Trappa]
I'm walkin' down in Magic City (walkin' down)
Look around, think about the majesty, yeah
Uh, so light in Magic City
Even no depression
And you know experience now
I'm feelin' good in Magic City
Fly with me, and there's no competition
Let's get Nelson
All this for the weekend
'Cause you rockin' on in the Magic City

[Verse 1: Yung Trappa]
Let night a walk to double borders
See, this lady watching so [? astad] at stupid thug (yeah)
Talk that shit, I would that Glock shit
Walk like goddamn wow, wow, wow, wow
Girl, yah-ah-ah, all right
Talk shit, smoke shit, sipped in time
Ma, I'll make your will
Come and lie, and lie
This magic for my heart
Down, down, down in my town, full of ladies
I'm down in my city, Magic City gone crazy
Feelin' sexy, feelin' flexin'
Ain't no stressin', keys relate on 'em
Rollin', really, really rollin', yeah, yay

[Chorus: Yung Trappa]
I'm walkin' down in Magic City (walkin' down)
Look around, think about the majesty, yeah
Uh, so light in Magic City
Even no depression
And you know experience now
I'm feelin' good in Magic City
Fly with me, and there's no competition
Let's get Nelson
All this for the weekend
'Cause you rockin' on in the Magic City

[Verse 2: Yung Pretty]
I'm walkin' down in the Magic City
Youngest ma with Yung Pretty in the Magic City
This amazing bitch is purple bottle drinkin'
Yungs in the building, brand you for Magic Sprite City
Let me have a living, my mama told me: 'Live was a bitch'
And know, my all friends really [? pants], fucking sick
You love my magic space, yeah, I'm fly, shawty
Love my magic, weed rollin' everyday smoking
Another moon going, the Pretty gone lumped
And your hoe woman in my chain, homie
And I shine, homie, runnin' from my pretty hoe
Make a magic blow, fuck amazing girl

[Chorus: Yung Trappa]
I'm walkin' down in Magic City (walkin' down)
Look around, think about the majesty, yeah
Uh, so light in Magic City
Even no depression
And you know experience now
I'm feelin' good in Magic City
Fly with me, and there's no competition
Let's get Nelson
All this for the weekend
'Cause you rockin' on in the Magic City

[Outro: Yung Pretty]
Shawty sayin': 'Wow, wow, my magic Louis'
Shawty sayin': 'Wow, wow, think, my magic Gucci'
I gon' [? zoop] it, I gon' [? zoop] it
My love so die up in the sky
And my hustle cold, and my swag so cold
Yeah, I'm single, hoe
Yeah, I'm trippin', hope
In my Dirty Sprite, in my fucking cup
Weirdy, icy, yep
On the bullshit, yep, I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck
