[Текст песни «little angel»]

[Куплет]
Someone told me I should say
I’m not afraid of your stupid frames
Punch this door, destroy that hell
I’m falling apart, I’m falling apart
Loving you was such a game
I’m losing again, I’m losing again
Little angel, little angel
Help me find the way of so easion

[Рефрен]
I’m giving up, I’m giving up
I’m giving up, I’m giving up
I’m giving up, I’m giving up
I’m giving up, I’m giving up
